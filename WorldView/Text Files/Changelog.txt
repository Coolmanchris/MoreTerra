Release 1.6 TODO
Make it so that if the new MoreTerra folder in AppData does not exist it goes looking for the old
 names (one of which is my typo).  If it finds an old name it 
Do a bit more testing to be sure the program handles updating from the old UserSettings file properly.
For that matter code something that transfers the files from the AppData/TWV folder to the MoreTerra folder.

Release 1.6
==============
=New Features=
==============
Recreated Symbol list so that it shows the Symbols for each item next to the text for the item.

Added Marker drawing for Hellforges, Signs, all ores and all NPCs.  Hellforged colored yellow to help
 stand out against the very dark underworld.  Ore colors are all colored the same as the pixel that would
 be drawn if the Marker was off.

Added a reader function that will drop to the end of the world file and read in the footer and compare it
 with the check information found there.  It then puts the stream position back to where it was before it
 was called.  Useful for finding out if a file is a valid Terraria file.

World name now shows up in the Select World box.

Added a message box that shows up if the version of the file you are loading does not match what this
 program version is capable of handling.  Can be disabled but will show up again when the another new
 world version shows up.

Added a button that opens the MoreTerra Application Data/Resources folder to make it easier for people
 to change the symbol icons.

Changed the filter list around.  Now when you move something from one list to the other it removes it
 from the first list.  Added buttons to move all items at the same time, from one list to the other.
 Completely reincorporated ItemList.txt into the program again and now there are buttons that allow
 people to add new items to the list or remove an item no longer needed.  I personally like the fact
 that MoreTerra can be run from one file alone, without needing anything else in it's directory.
 Items that were added by the user show up with a * on them.  Of course, when the code catches up
 those *'s will go back away.

Added a system where it does pop-ups asking you to add objects found in chests that were not
 already in the list.

Added two items (Breathing Reed, Flipper) to the in-file ItemList.

Added sorting the Chest list in one of three ways.  Also changed the chest list to only fill in based
 on what items are in the filter list.  You do not need to hit Load Info/Draw again when the filter
 changes.

Made it so that the Scan item pop-up will not happen in console mode and the version mismatch will only
 show a message.  We do not want to pause the program waiting for user input in console mode.
===========
=Bug Fixes=
===========
Fixed a bug where if Draw Walls was turned off it was drawing black instead of Sky color.

Fixed a bug where items that could have a symbol on the map were not getting their colors drawn
 if you turned off drawing of those symbols.

Fixed a bug where the InputDirectory was being opened if it did not exist if the Terraria directory
 did exist.

The new symbol drawing code was throwing a very odd out of array range error and I tracked it down to a longstanding
 bug.  Seems Terraria stores the map height then width but they were being read in as width then height.  Flipped it
 and the places it references to fix it.

Fixed a bug where the Select World box was not reloading the list when you would change to a new directory.

Fixed the small bug that was stopping the chest filter from loading from the settings properly.

=============
=Refactoring=
=============
Changed the names of the marker PNG files to match the pattern of their type.  This only affects
 internal names of the files.  The copies found in APPDATA have the same names as before.

Changed every reference from TerrariaWorldViewer to MoreTerra, except for those needed for Migration.

Fixed the spelling of Meteorite and changed the two CorruptionStone items to their in-game names.
 Also changed UnderworldFurnace over to Hellforge.  Changed Door1 and Door2 to Door & DoorOpen.
 Changed the three Herb tiles to match the status names from the official Wiki (Immature, Mature, Blooming)

Changed the name of the chest filter list box so that they match each other.  They are now
 lstAvailableItems and lstFilteredItems.  Bit of a nitpick.  Now to try and keep my hands off
 off things like "IsWallsDrawable".

Reorganized the files into folders & namespaces.  Structures (data but no real code) are in one.
 Utilities are in the other.  ProfileStructs is the only one that defies this as it is tied into
 the profiler and only the profiler.  Might just need to stuff it inside the Profiler class, like
 how UserSettings is.

==============
=Optimization=
==============
Added a Profiling class so that it is easier to test to see how long certain tasks take.

Added a new property to TileProperties to cache the lookup for what objects are being drawn.  This way
 it sets it before even reading a single tile so that 
 one fast Boolean lookup + one costly Dictionary.ContainsKey turns into just one fast Boolean lookup.

Changed symbol drawing code so that the check to see if we are drawing them
 happens before adding them to the list instead of adding symbols for
 everything on the map to a huge list and then filtering there.  Should be faster now.

Added code that will read backwards along the world file to get to the chests faster.  The slowest I ever
 got the code to run was half a second, which handily beats the 2 to 7 second read time the old way.
 It does still throw up occasional hiccups when a false positive happens when reading a string but then
 reads using the old style instead.

Folded the tile reading into ReadWorldTiles directly instead of 20 million calls to GetNextTile.




Release 1.5

==============
=New Features=
==============
Changed the way the Chest Filtering works
Chest Filter item list is now loaded from ItemList.txt, now it's easy to add new items after an update!

===============
=Compatibility=
===============
Made compatible with 1.0.5 by adding the new tiles.
Added Terraria 1.0.5 items to the Chest Filter tab.

===========
=Bug Fixes=
===========
Fixed XP compatiblity.

=============
=Refactoring=
=============
Renamed project to MoreTerra.




Future Versions
==============
= MAYBE TODO =
==============
Add some sort of versioning system to the settings file so we can propogate changes
 without forcing the user to delete it.  This might not be needed.  The primary headache
 was that when I tried to add the ore types they'd refuse to load but the list no longer
 gets populated straight from the Settings file but only pulls the Boolean part from it.
 Adding new checkboxes works fine.
 Adding new items to the chest filter works fine as well.
 Pushing updates to the resource pictures in the Resources directory probably will not be
 needed once the "Use custom pictures" part is done.

==============
=    TODO    =
==============
Add a TSR type system to the prgram that instead of simply drawing a map and exiting instead
 monitors that map file and redraws a short bit after the file updates.  Will have to add
 a keyboard interface, kind of like how the Terraria Server does.  Possibly with an increasing
 filename & max # of files to keep.  

Change how the settings file is loaded so that people can set things up the way they like
 and provide that on the command line to use the settings in that file instead.  That way
 people could potentially run the program twice each cron tick.  Once for one setup and one
 for another.  Like a map only and a map with items.

Find a way to stuff Min/Max filtering into the new Symbol list.  Decided I'll make some items
 outside of the treeview list for that.  All my ideas about making it show up in the TreeView
 are too complicated to do.

See if we can find a way to add 3-state checkboxes to the TreeView list.  I could hack this now
 using images but I'd really like to have something nicer looking.

Reorganize things so that we have proper world objects instead of the horrible broken mix.

Redo the Progress bar code to remove the unusual jumps when reading the world in.  Probably
 by basing it on file size read in instead.  Chests read in so instantly that it doesn't quite
 make sense.  Possibly change it over to a Dialog box that pops up instead of on the status bar.
 There's really nothing that anyone can do while waiting for it to draw anyways.

Find a way to show whether a chest is a brown or gold chest on the map.

Add a way to change the colors of all the tiles as they get drawn.  Change the Symbols so that
 as you change the icons the Symbols change too.

Add a popout color option so maps get drawn with only some things in the right colors and the others
 in a greyscale form.

Change all the structures over to private with get/set functions.

Perfect the code for seeking to chests.
 We need to have a way to handle bad string matches.  This likely should only affect signs though
 as it seems to only happen if the string is over 32 bytes in length so that say a space gets
 interpreted as a string length of 32.

See if we can manage to get this running under Mono for those users.  Runs (kind of) for me under
 the windows version of Mono.  A lot of stuff is offset really poorly, some things so far as to
 switch sides of the Table control they are found in.  Program crashes for some reason when trying
 to Load Information but doesn't when Drawing a map.  So odd.

Change the way the resource files are read in so we can provide a check box for "Use custom files".

Small bug in the filter boxes that keeps the "Remove custom item" box from turning on until
 you've clicked the object twice.

Write a small bit of code that simply reads a world file and turns every square's IsLighted to false
 just to see what happens.  20% of every Terraria world file is taken up with that Boolean and I 
 strongly suspect that it does nothing at all as the lighting system seems to generate on the fly
 anyways.  I figure that could easily fit into the "Finding tile frames" loading segment and save
 some disk space.

Change FormMessageBoxWithCheckBox to be more generic like the basic MessageBox class.  Might not need
 to do a thing except for removing the current text from the Initialization and provide a way
 to read the checkbox state.  Maybe add a way to size the dialog around the text provided to it.
 Partially done.  No resizing yet and it's not perfect but it's working.

Finish changing all of the references to Symbol over to Marker instead.

Consider adding an herb tracker.  Unlike Mushrooms herbs actually can be found in the file.

Find a way to get the DialogBoxes from the worker thread to correctly attach to the main window.

Remember to increment version number in project properties!

Add search to the "available items" chest item list, in winamp's jump to file style (search as you type, pressing enter adds the item)
 (Sol: I do want a better keyboard interface for the list.  This might not be too hard to implement)

Add gold chest filter (possible?)
 (Sol: Completely possible.  I'd need to rework how the ReadWorldTiles code works though)

Use game resources (tiles) as world markers (altar, chest, orb... requires XNA?)
 (Sol: Yes and no.  I can easily pull the graphics from the files and we could use them but I'm not sure
 how legal that would be.  Using the data files from Terraria itself instead of distributing them would
 take XNA but would probably be more legal)

Add meteor ore marker + tile color
 (Sol: No tile color but a marker, still running Magenta)

Better colors (gold/copper, silver/cobwebs), generate a color legend somewhere
 (Sol: Does this need to be on the map?  I have plans to add a Colors tab for custom colors)

Refactor Settings Manager
 (Sol: What did you have in mind with this?)


Considering / suggestions from reddit:
Add torch marker
 (Sol: Making the icon would take longer than making the code do it. Esp because torches are single square)

Auto-generating an image after each auto save (monitor .bak file?)
 (Sol: Already on my list)

Is it possible to add this in the world info?
    Chests count
    Hearts count
    Iron/Copper/Silver/Gold/Gems Ores count
 (Sol: All these are possible to add to the world info list box.  However the hearts & gems/ores 
       would only get generated when doing a full process.  I already had the code counting these
	   things anyways when I was testing out the new marker system I added.  We could potentially
	   make it count every single tile type of the map.)

Also, is it possible to search/sort chests in the  World Information tab?
 (Sol: Both already done)
