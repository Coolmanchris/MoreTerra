Made compatible with 1.0.5 by adding the new tiles
Save list of items for chest filter in a separate file


TODO:
Remember to increment version number in project properties!
Add search to the "available items" chest item list, in winamp's jump to file style (search as you type, pressing enter adds the item)
Add gold chest filter (possible?)
Use game resources (tiles) as world markers (altar, chest, orb... requires XNA?)
Add meteor ore marker + tile color
Better colors (gold/copper, silver/cobwebs), generate a color legend somewhere
Refactor Settings Manager



Considering / suggestions from reddit:
Add torch marker
Auto-generating an image after each auto save (monitor .bak file?)
Is it possible to add this in the world info?
    Chests count
    Hearts count
    Iron/Copper/Silver/Gold/Gems Ores count


Also, is it possible to search/sort chests in the  World Information tab?
